## Data Curation: A guide to API's and Scraping- Featuring Lewis Hamilton

### Overview
The contents of this repository include the code to use a free Formula 1 API code and download a custom data set of F1 Statistics. I complied with the Ergast terms of use and used their documentation page. 

The code provided focuses specifically on Lewis Hamilton- one of the top drivers from formula 1- and walks through reading in the API and specifically grabbing Hamilton's data, Cleaning, and selecting our custom stats to make a unique table. 

Documentation in the code specifies how to change the API key for a specific driver/how to select certain variables so that you could create a unique data set based on the driver and stats you find most interesting.

Enjoy! and big shoutout to whoever put together this API key and made it so easy to access Formula 1 statistics from thousands of races.
